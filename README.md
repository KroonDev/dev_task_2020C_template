```
Your answer...
```
**3. Can you refactor the above function in order to satisfy all requirements without changing the input and output structure?**
```csharp
// Your C# refactored code goes here
```
**4. What’s the linear complexity of your solution? (approximately)**
```
Your answer...
```
**5. Can you write a unit test for the above function?**
```csharp
// Your C# unit test goes here
```
**6. Can you write a stress test for the above function?**
```csharp
// Your C# stress test goes here
```
### *Optional questions:

**2. What’s the linear complexity of the above solution? (approximately)**
```
Your answer...
```
**3. Can you refactor the above function in order to satisfy all requirements without changing the input and output structure?**
```csharp
// Your C# refactored code goes here
```
**4. What’s the linear complexity of your solution? (approximately)**
```
Your answer...
```
**5. Can you write a unit test for the above function?**
```csharp
// Your C# unit tests go here
```
**6. Can you write a stress test for the above function?**
```csharp
// Your C# stress test goes here
```
### *Optional questions:
**1. In the initial requirements we search for terms that are contained in any part of the text. Can you change this in order to add “\*” (star character) support? For example: the search terms “full of\*” or “full of\*ness” are satisfying the results with the title “Full of happiness” but don’t match with the title “The full of darkness”.**
```csharp
// Your C# refactored code including the "*" (star character) support goes here
```
**2. We decided to move this code in a NodeJS project, can you translate the original function to Javascript equivalent code?**
```javascript
// Javascript equivalent code goes here
```
**3. Can you translate your refactored function to Javascript equivalent code?**
```javascript
// Your Javascript equivalent code goes here
```
**4. Can you write unit tests and stress tests for your translated Javascript code?**
```javascript
// Your Javascript unit test goes here
```
```javascript
// Your Javascript stress test goes here
```

```
Your answer...
```
**3. Can you write a unit tests for your function?**
```csharp
// Your C# unit test goes here.
```
**4. Can you write a stress test for your function?**
```csharp
// Your C# stress test goes here.
```
### *Optional questions:

```javascript
// Javascript equivalent code goes here
```
**2. Can you write unit tests and stress tests for your translated Javascript code?**
```javascript
// Your Javascript unit test goes here
```
```javascript
// Your Javascript stress test goes here
```
